# What is DHCP
DHCP is a way of assigning IP addresses automatically rather than assigning them manually. This usually is helpful when you have tens and thousands of devices to assign IP addresses in a network.

# Benifits
1. Reduces the workload of a system administrator.
2. Eradicates the problem of duplicate IP addresses.
3. Convenience

# Drawbacks
1. Configurations during initial implementations.
